# 🌲 Trees

The **Tree** is one of the most fundamental non-linear data structures in computer science.  
It represents hierarchical relationships and forms the foundation for many advanced structures like **Heaps**, **Tries**, and **Segment Trees**.

---

## 📘 Overview

A **Tree** is a collection of nodes connected by edges, with the following key properties:
- A single root node (topmost element)
- Each child node has exactly one parent
- No cycles exist (acyclic structure)

Common use cases include:
- Hierarchical data representation (e.g., file systems, DOM)
- Searching and sorting (e.g., BST)
- Expression parsing (e.g., syntax trees)
- Efficient data queries (e.g., Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees)

## 🌿 Topics Covered

| Subtopic | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Binary Tree (BT)** | General tree where each node has at most 2 children |
| **Binary Search Tree (BST)** | Ordered tree for efficient searching and insertion |
| **Tree Traversals** | Inorder, Preorder, Postorder, Level-order |
| **Height & Depth** | Tree height, diameter, and depth computations |
| **Balanced Trees** | AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree, Treap, Splay Tree |
| **Tree-based DP** | Dynamic programming on trees (subtree sums, path queries, etc.) |
| **Applications** | Expression trees, decision trees, network hierarchies |

---

## 🧠 Practice Path

1. Understand basic tree structure and traversal methods  
2. Implement recursive and iterative traversals  
3. Explore BST operations — insertion, deletion, and search  
4. Learn to compute height, diameter, and balance  
5. Solve problems involving paths, ancestors, and subtree properties
